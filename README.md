Voter Registration Splash Page

The registration_page.php is an example of a dynamic template that can be changed while logged in as wordpress admin.

registration_page.php is a copy of the text for the voter registation dynamic page. 

The actual page can be found in the text editor for nevada's voting page. 

The rest pulls automatically from the index.php and functions.php files.

There is a database built that holds voter information such as first name, last name, email, and zip. But for security purposes, i didn't actually connect the database.
